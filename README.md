# ImageCombine

This is a single-page web application that combines images to one image file in multiple grid configurations (1x2, 1x3, 2x2, 2x3, 3x3). Input the image links in the configuration that is required and the web application will output and save an image file to the server. The images being combined can be of any size and they will be resized to fit in the new image. There is basic form validation in this web application, such as requiring at least two image links and recognizing incorrect image links.
